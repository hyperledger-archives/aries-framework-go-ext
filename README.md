Hyperledger Aries Framework Go enables trusted communication and data exchange based on interoperable distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) interactions.
We provide a flexible toolkit to enable the usage of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID-to-DID communications, verifiable credential exchange, transaction authorizations, and data communication protocols. From these building blocks, implementors can build agents, mediators and other DIDComm features in a manner that is agnostic to a particular DID network or governance framework.
